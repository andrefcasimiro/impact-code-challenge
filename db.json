The result is an incredibly intense citrus hop blast unlike anything we've experienced here at Tree House. Mango, orange, and sweet grapefruit are predominant in the aroma with hints of pineapple and blended tropical fruit juice. The taste mirrors the aroma with a juicy mouthfeel and a proper bitterness. Fluffy. This beer challenges the sense and rewards the palate as it warms in the glass. Complex, raw, and beautiful, the amplified King is a beer we are excited to share with you to celebrate four years of Tree House. Thank you! ",

At the first draught, the mouth is overcome by woody, malty flavours, sustained by a discrete touch of sweetness. The aftertaste brings about the flavours of maple, which are sufficiently present to be appreciated, but never overwhelming the typical flavours of a Scotch Ale. ",
